Mod Manager [for Rooftops &amp; Alleys](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2703850/Rooftops__Alleys_The_Parkour_Game/)

# Current State
This project has just been started so it's nowhere near a workable state.

If you're looking to contribute, by all means please do, as I am doing this as a learning project but plan to make this a fully featured manager for Rooftops and Alleys. You can check out the issues section for things needed to be done!

I am mostly comfortable with languages that do not require GUI, such as Go, so C# and WPF are not my strongest, please don't expect amazing work or idiomatic practices to be done, there are bound to be a lot of mistakes I make here, especially with the GUI and idioms specific to C#.

# Roadmap
- [ ] - Accept various compressed file formats (7z, RAR, Zip, etc) to extract mods from
- [ ] - Structure mods in a fashion that is orderly in the game's mod location, folders such as `Clothing`, `Maps` etc
- [ ] - Enable / Disable mods
- [ ] - Mod integrity checking
- [ ] - Integration with Nexus (This will require an API key or SSO from the user) to provide a list of mods, and download them
- [ ] - Modern GUI
